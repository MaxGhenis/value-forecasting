  abstract: |
    AI alignment requires understanding human values, but values evolve as material
    conditions change. We propose treating alignment partly as a forecasting problem:
    what values would humanity hold as the veil of scarcity lifts? Using the General
    Social Survey (1972-2024) as ground truth, we test whether LLMs can forecast value
    trajectories. In historical validation, LLMs outperform time series baselines by
    2.2× on mean absolute error, capturing the 51-point liberalization in attitudes
    toward same-sex relationships (11% to 62%) that occurred from 1973-2021. While
    short-term fluctuations occur (the 2024 reading dipped to 55% amid a polarized
    election year and survey mode changes), the long-term trajectory remains robust.
    Crucially, we find a strong income-values gradient: high-income respondents show
    24 points more acceptance than low-income respondents, suggesting material conditions
    causally influence values. This gradient provides empirical grounding for post-scarcity
    projections—higher-income individuals today approximate the conditions of average
    individuals under AI-driven abundance. We propose conditional value forecasting as
    an alignment methodology: rather than anchoring to current preferences shaped by
    current constraints, align to forecasted values under specified post-scarcity scenarios.
    This approach treats heterogeneity as a feature, uncertainty as quantifiable, and
    alignment targets as distributions rather than point estimates.
