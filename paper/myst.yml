  abstract: |
    AI alignment requires understanding human values, but values evolve over time.
    We propose treating alignment partly as a forecasting problem: can language models
    predict how human values will change? Using the General Social Survey (1972-2024)
    as ground truth, we test whether LLMs can forecast value trajectories. In historical
    validation, LLMs outperform time series baselines by 2.2× on mean absolute error.
    However, a methodologically clean test—using GPT-4o (October 2023 cutoff) to predict
    GSS 2024 data—reveals a critical limitation: the model predicted continued liberalization
    (69% acceptance of same-sex relationships) while the actual value reversed to 55%,
    a 7-point drop from 2021. We find this reversal occurred across demographic groups
    but was strongest among Republicans and young adults. These results suggest that
    while LLMs capture historical trends, they fail to predict backlash dynamics—when
    social progress triggers counter-mobilization. We discuss implications for using
    value forecasting as an alignment target.
